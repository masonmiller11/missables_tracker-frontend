# Missables Tracker!
Hey! Welcome! Enjoy your stay. Any feedback is always appreciated! 

## Project Description
I enjoy video games. I especially enjoy RPGs and action adventure games. The problem with a lot of older RPGs and JRPGs
is that they have a lot of missable items. Stuff that if you don't obtain it by a certain point of the game, it's lost
forever (well until you start a new playthrough). I hate that. 

So I wanted to create an app where you could keep track of missables in games. Here's how it works:

- Users can upload guides (I call them templates).
- Each template will have a list of items that are missable in the game.
- When you start a new playthrough of a game with missables, you can find a template for that game and create a new
playthrough using that template. You'll then be able to check off missables as you progress.
  
So if you were to start a playthrough of say, *Tales of Vesperia*, you'd search for a template of that game created by
another user (or add one yourself). You would then start a new playthrough based off that template and check items off
as you progress.

## Backend Repository
You can find the backend of this project [here](https://github.com/masonmiller11/missables_tracker). 

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
