# Missables Tracker!
Hey! Welcome! Enjoy your stay. Any feedback is always appreciated! 

## Project Description
I enjoy video games. I especially enjoy RPGs and action adventure games. The problem with a lot of older RPGs and JRPGs
is that they have a lot of missable items. Stuff that if you don't obtain it by a certain point of the game, it's lost
forever (well until you start a new playthrough). I hate that. 

So I wanted to create an app where you could keep track of missables in games. Here's how it works:

- Users can upload guides (I call them templates).
- Each template will have a list of items that are missable in the game.
- When you start a new playthrough of a game with missables, you can find a template for that game and create a new
playthrough using that template. You'll then be able to check off missables as you progress.
  
So if you were to start a playthrough of say, *Tales of Vesperia*, you'd search for a template of that game created by
another user (or add one yourself). You would then start a new playthrough based off that template and check items off
as you progress.
